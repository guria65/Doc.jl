== Design

=== Part I -- Definition of DOC

DOC is a global dictionary object, where the keys are any object
one wishes to document, and the value is any object that implements
`writemime` with at least the following MIME types:

----
writemime("meta/summary", DOC[f] )
writemime("meta/author", DOC[f] )
writemime("meta/date", DOC[f] )
writemime("text/plain", DOC[f] )
writemime("text/html", DOC[f] )
----

In addition, `DOC[f].meta` must be an array listing all the metadata
available for the object.


=== Part II - @doc macro

Anyone can write a macro for documentation, as long as it fills the
DOC object correctly, as indicated in Part I. A macro based on
AsciiDoc may look like this:

[source]
----
@doc """
 :author: Daniel Carrera
 :summary: One sentence summary of what the function does.
 :param:  ...
 :param:  ...
 :return: ...

The rest of the docstring is a more detailed description
of the function. Everything in the docstring is processed
by some http://www.asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] parser.

* Include.
* Bullet.
* Lists.
