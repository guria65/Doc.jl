== Design

=== Part I -- Definition of DOC

DOC is a global dictionary object. The keys are string representations
of Julia objects. The values are themselves dictionary objects of
type `Dict{Symbol,String}`, containing the documentation and metadata.
For example:

----
DOC[f][:date]
DOC[f][:author]
DOC[f][:docstring]
DOC[f][:description]
----

You can obtain a list of the available metadata with `keys(DOC[f])`.
The only keys that are included automatically are `:docstring` and
`:description`. Finally, the `help()` function simply returns
`DOC[f][:description]`.


=== Part II - @doc macro

Anyone can write a macro for documentation, as long as it fills the
DOC object correctly, as indicated in Part I. A macro based on
AsciiDoc may look like this:

[source]
----
@doc """
 :author: Daniel Carrera
 :summary: One sentence summary of what the function does.
 :param:  ...
 :param:  ...
 :return: ...

The rest of the docstring is a more detailed description
of the function. Everything in the docstring is processed
by some http://www.asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] parser.

* Include.
* Bullet.
* Lists.
