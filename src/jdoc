=== jdoc

This is a command-line program that extract all the docstrings out of
a Julia file (respecting `include` directives) to help produce manuals.
The program is a work in progress, but here is the intended API:

* `jdoc --raw` prints the unprocessed raw docstring. This allows users to
use an external program to process the docstring. Thus, users can use any
markup, like LaTeX, ReST or raw HTML.

* `jdoc` includes the *JDoc* markup format. JDoc is a subset of Asciidoc.
It is simpler, has a short learning curve, and is well suited for writing
program documentation. With it, `jdoc` can output other formats like HTML,
without requiring external programs.


This is how I intend `jdoc` to work:

----
jdoc example.jl         --  Pager, similar to man pages or perloc.
jdoc --raw  example.jl  --  Output raw docstring.
jdoc --html exampe.jl   --  Output HTML.
----

I also want to think about how `jdoc` should support the `@doc` macro
provided by the JDoc.jl module.
